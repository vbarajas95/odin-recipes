  <p>The Crunchwrap Supreme was introduced into Taco Bell's menu in 2005 for a limited time. On January 2006, it was permanently inducted onto the menu. The Crunchwrap Supreme is a wrap consisting of a protein, veggies, cheese, sour cream, and a tostada all wrapped into a toasted flour tortilla. According to Taco Bell, "this is the product that wrote, and broke, all the rules". </p>
